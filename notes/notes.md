WebGL - 3d content low level
Works in most modern browser
it's hard to use

Open source - easier to manages 3D content

You have to load files through a server
npm live server
have it running at the root of the file:
npm install -g live-server
then run 
live-server
to quit use ctrl + c

Minified file -smaller size but debugging is harder 
for development use non-minified files.
